**Database**: Databases persist or save data from our application.

**Models**: The 'logic' of a web application. This is where data is manipulated and/or saved. The model can talk to the database by asking for certain data and using that data to create a new instance of our class
* the cook

**Controllers**: The go-between for models and views. The controller relays data from the browser to the application, and from the application to the browser. Controls appilcation logic such as "What data should I show a user in response to certain input from that user?"
* the waiters

**Views**: The 'front-end', user-facing part of a web application - this is the only part of the app that the user interacts with directly. Views generally consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript; generally represented by ERB templates that generate HTML.
* plates of food


**User/Browser**: top of our application pyramid is the user. Either describing the people using our application or or the program they use to even access our application,ie browser.
